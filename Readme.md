# About
<p> Let's learn some ways of sorting algorithms from cluster analysis </p>

# Requirements
<p> I recommend downloading the R cran installer https://cran.r-project.org/ and later the RStudio software https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ to run the scripts below and view the interactions </p>

# Problem
<p> I need to identify which groups of students have difficulties in common with determining the end of assistant teacher causes. </p>

# Solution
<p> Create an algorithm capable of generating groups that are homogeneous among themselves and heterogeneous among groups. </p>

# Method
<p> The approaches: "distance euclidean", approaches: "average", "single", "complete" and "ward.D" will be used. (hierarchical) </p>

# Visualization
<p> The dendrogram approach will be used due to the nature of the database </p>

# Conclusion
<p>  Group 2 has the lowest grades in all subjects. In this way, it will be possible to concentrate efforts efficiently using heterogeneous approaches. </p>
